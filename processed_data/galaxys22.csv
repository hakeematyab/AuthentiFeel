"3/8/24 first impressions might be 9/10 to 10/10 will update in time about battery.First impression:. Received yesterday. quick delivery. I opened it immediately, the delivery man was still in sight. It was off and at 14%. Packaged fine. It came with a block & cord don't know the wattage tho. The phone looked brand new BUT I thought two of cameras looked a little scuffed, taking pics looked fine, turned out two lens had old worn lens protectors on them is why it looked ugly lol (others lens had none), under them was pristine lens. I charged the phone. Actually a few times since yesterday I have charged it. Battery life seems to very bad but researching settings for improvements. Have changed many but still learning. The charging seems a lot slower time too vs my old 20+. It will say 2 or 3 hours but my 4 year old phone will say an hour on same cord with a low battery even etc. and it bleeds battery faster than my older phone. But again need to play with more settings maybe. Researching. Might be a s22 problem from my reading but this could be more I'm not sure yet. Video, sound quality & everything looks amazing. Love all the settings, ringtones even everything is better lol. WiFi. I love the s-pen. Seems to work. It's beautiful. But haven't tested everything but what I have seems new. No issues putting my phone card in or transfering all data. I put an OtterBox on it and screen protectors. I didn't notice starches or impressions but I didn't look super close bc I wanted it protected. I love it so much, even my than I expected too besides the battery life erc but I'm holding hope it will be just fine if I play with it. I've named her Nancy lol🤞

 If no FURTHER edits are posted after this review, then everything's working as it should again!
] : After posting this review, I'm STILL satisfied with the PHONE itself! Don't get me wrong, this thing is BADASS for the price I got it for! Still awesome!The only thing I found, and you can see for yourself in the video that I posted above where I write ""Pen Works Great"" was, that I'd constantly receive this message, saying that my phone wouldn't connect to the S PEN that the phone came with, in conjunction with denying me of the (Air Actions) features that the phone comes programmed with?So I just simply bought a brand new (""Samsung"" branded) S Pen, and NOW the phone and ALL of its features works %100 as it should! I'm assuming the S Pen that came with the phone was an aftermarket pen or something. So in conclusion, if you run into the same issue, just buy a new S Pen from ""Samsung"" themselves! It fixed the issue for me!Shipping:Phone arrived immediately on the next business day (Monday), 3 days after ordering it (Friday).In the box:-Phone-Fast Adaptive Charger Base-Fast Charging CableUnboxing/ Initial Impression:Outstanding condition of the phone itself! Not a single scratch, not a single fingerprint (other than my own fingerprints after unwrapping it). The box came well-packaged, and inside of an envelope.SIM Installation:Now, I DO have to say..-I read another reviewers comment, saying that BEFORE installing the SIM card, one should UPDATE THE PHONE'S SOFTWARE until it no longer needs to update. Which I did. So, after it updated to December's latest software.. I installed the SIM card. Works flawlessly. Sent and received phone calls/ texts/ etc.S Pen:Pen works great!Final words:If you're thinking about it... DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. Get the phone! Highly recommend selecting the ""excellent condition"" option. I've just upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S10 to this Galaxy S22 Ultra, and WOW have I been missing out on this technology.. Time will always tell, so look out for any edits, but so far so good!

"As the listing says, it's supposed to be unlocked to any carrier. Received the phone and after speaking to my phone provider (mint mobile), Amazon support and finally Samsung support, I find that the phone is carrier locked to T-mobile. T-mobile tells me the imei number on the phone (unique to every phone) is linked to an account that wasn't fully paid off and they can't unlock it for me, so I was stuck with essentially a paperweight and camera.Phone is in good condition, though, so I'll give them that.

"The first phone I received had a generic replacement screen. In the first picture you can see how the screen has a huge black bezel, compared to the next one with the correct screen. The screen was also blurry compared to the correct screen. Also the battery seemed to go down faster than normal. However, the company responded promptly and replaced it. The next phone has minimal signs of wear and functions properly with the correct screen. Overall happy with my purchase now.
"
"The phone was in good shape with it came to me. I really was excited to have it, but it just didn't work with my network.  Overall super happy with the seller, made sure the return was easy and fast.
"
"I received my phone yesterday. The quality looks almost brand new. There were no blemishes that I could see. All cameras work well.. no scratches. And it transfered everything over flawlessly. And no connection issues either.  The only slight issue I had was that the pen was missing... however a quick message to the seller, and they fixed the problem for me. The seller is very quick to reply is helpful. Thank you guys so much!

"Vengo de un Xiaomi mi9t, que para estos tiempos sobre todo por la falta de actualización de android queda un poco obsoleto, así que buscaba opciones de una gama mayor pero no tenía pensado en gastar tanto, con equipos que que sobrepasan los 15 o 20 mil; revisando opciones como oneplus, xiaomi o pixel, ví como una opción un gama alta de hace un par de años pero reacondicionado, siempre hay dudas de cómo resultará no siendo 100% nuevo pero me decidí y qué bien me fué, el estado del teléfono está impecable, ni siquiera un liger rasguño, eso sí, el cómo venía empaquetado me hizo pensar lo peor, no es que fuera un mal empaquetado o inseguro, pero venía en un sobre abierto sin nada más que un cargador genérico y un par de tarjetas. En sí el equipo es excepcional, la diferencia con el xiaomi es abismal, todo lo bueno que escuches en reviews es verdad. Yo personalmente lo recomiendo to-tal-men-te.
"
"The phone didn't come in its original packaging or with its original screen cover but I didn't notice any scratches or cosmetic damage and it works fantastically.I love this phone and am hoping it lasts me a long time with all the updates promised by Samsung. It's packed with great features and the pen is really handy and makes the phone feel unique.The macro capabilities of the camera setup blew me away; I'll be using them a lot for my small business so I'm very pleased!I feel like I got a sweet deal on an awesome phone so definitely 5 stars! 🤩

"Le chargeur et la boîte ne sont pas d'origine mais aucun signe d'usure. Comme neuf et fonctionne à merveille
"
"Hasta el momento gran celular, cámara, procesador. Tenía mis dudas por ser renovado pero salió muy bueno a buen precio. Si lo quieres para jugar no te rendirá la batería. Unos normal/dándole! Apenas llegas a terminar el día con Batería.  Sería lo único.
"
"Es la primera vez que compro un celular así, estéticamente es un 9, tanto la pantalla y la parte trasera están como nuevas, igual ya le he colocado una mica de hidrogel para proteger la pantalla, donde está un poco deteriorado es en el marco, tiene algunas rayaduras, sobre todo en el puerto de carga, estéticamente es todo.De funcionamiento, aparentemente funciona bien, no se traba, va fluido, aunque noto que se calienta mucho después de 2 minutos de uso normal, no le he puesto tareas exigentes ni he jugado, eso me preocupa, las cámaras también aparentemente funcionan bien, le puse mi chip AT&T y funciona sin problemas, veré como se comporta en los próximos días y si el calentamiento disminuye, si no, tendré que devolverlo.

"Had a galaxy S9+ for years. Refused to trade it in. Never a fan of getting a phone ""just because"". I don't need the best, ultimate, fastest, highest quality phone every year. So, went ahead and bought this one last year. Figured I would wait a while before posting a review. Fantastic product. Especially for the money. I'd argue you're getting this at a steal. If you're looking to upgrade your phone, I'd definitely recommend trying these certified phones here if you're not a fan of being ripped off with newer phones that depreciate by >30% in a matter of minutes when you can get a like-new phone for cheaper. And this phone has nothing wrong with it. Coming from my past experiences where I tried getting refurbished/used phones (even from mobile carriers) and there was issues with the software or hardware, I can say this is definitely not the case.I'm definitely going to be doing this again in the future. Screw cell phone carriers.

"I waited for some time to leave this review as some customers stated that phones started working worse in a few months. I got the S22, the phone was unlocked, it was properly packaged, and there were scratches on the phone, as expected, as the phone was previously owned. While booting (which was done in the summer), the phone overheated, but it was a one-time thing that happened during the setup. The camera gets laggy and hot if in use for a long time(like a realllly long time). Overall, the CPU used with this model has the issue, so overheating is not a big deal or a surprise. During everyday life, it works great, takes good pictures, and sounds okay; the fingerprint sensor works fine, and so does the face recognition. The only thing I am not very sure of is if the phone is waterproof, but it's easy to check; I just need to meet a technician. Overall, it is a good product with enough value for the price. It came with a cable AND a charging block that gives super fast charging. I wasn't expecting it, but it was nice to get. Overall, battery life is okay; my previous phone worked almost the same, so nothing too bad for me. Also, I have turned on the battery limitation (it can only charge up to 85% now), and I still go through 2/3 of the day. I always have a charger by my side and never really drained the battery, but I guess it would go through the day with constant use.
"
"I was skeptical at first because when I received the phone it kept updating itself but I got confidence when I read it was normal until it reached its missed updates.  It is now fully and working like a charm.  My phone is so cute, fast,  with all the bells and whistles. Great buy!

"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S22 Smartphone in Phantom White (Renewed) and I am thoroughly impressed with this device. The phone is factory unlocked, which gives me the flexibility to use it with any carrier, and the 128GB storage capacity is more than enough to store all of my photos, videos, and apps.The camera on this phone is nothing short of amazing. The 8K camera and video capabilities allow me to capture stunning, high-quality footage and the resulting images are incredibly clear and detailed. I love the fact that I can take professional-level photos and videos with just my phone.The display on the Samsung Galaxy S22 is also fantastic. It is incredibly bright and vivid, making it easy to see even in direct sunlight. The long battery life ensures that I can use my phone throughout the day without worrying about it dying on me.The fast 4nm processor is another standout feature of this phone. It runs very smoothly and quickly, which makes multitasking a breeze. I can switch between apps and tasks without any lag or delay.Overall, I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S22 Smartphone to anyone in the market for a high-quality Android cell phone. The renewed version is an excellent value and performs just as well as a brand new device. You won't be disappointed with this purchase!

"+The phone arrived a day earlier than the shipping prediction indicated (I might not have needed the extra $14 to advance delivery by a day).--->>> 1 month Update: This phone's Data and phone reception is Horrible no matter where I go in the Baltimore metro area!  Comparing side by side with working S-6 and S-7 phones this phone will not detect a Data signal in many urban settings where I could previously make and receive calls, offering the Ø symbol rather than (empty) reception bars. Calls will not come through unless I am on WiFi.  ( Wifi transmissions/receptions frequently completely drops off when moving from room to room in an average size house with 6 WiFi access points. Not so with the S-6 or S-7).---->> October 4, 2023 Update: The phone refused to take or make calls unless I was almost underneath a  Cell Tower. I took it to Verizon, and they could not evaluate antenna performance. GeekSquad was also unable to evaluate poor connectivity. The phone simply failed to perform basic cell phone duties. (WiFi connectivity was weak also).  And So I took advantage of Verizon's Phone Insurance plan where they gave me a replacement at no cost.  --- In the End, this purchase was not worth it.-- ""Excellent condition"" seems to me should be a just tiny bit shy of new in the box. In my case the metal edge at the top and bottom had the finish worn off, and the phone appears to have suffered a minor drop as there was a noticeable but not deep, depression in the screen and metal rim at the top of the phone. (The screen may be made from a similar material as that for folding phones so that it does not shatter for some drop types) There does not appear to be any diminishment to the screen performance/color-saturation.-- The generic ""C"" charger cable does not easily fit into the phone.  The first time I plugged it in I could not get it to seat so I had to fiddle with it to stay in, wedging the phone to keep it from sliding out. While it showed charging had started it must have come loose shortly after as it did not charge over night. ""C"" connectors are supposed to fit up or down, but this one only snaps fully in one way. [My Samsung S-6' micro-B had failed after two years and so I was not anxious to use force on any USB (I am an experienced systems / tech manager so this isn't a fear of tech thing)].

"I have been using an iPhone since 2009 (a 3G was my first one).  I have all other Apple products, but became disenchanted with the iPhone with the 11 ProMax and all subsequent models.  There was NOTHING new or exciting about the iPhone any longer.  After literally months of debate, I took the leap to the Galaxy S22 Ultra.  Let me say this loud and clear... I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH THIS PHONE!!!  I love that it is unlocked so I took it to my carrier, and it was connected in 3 minutes.  I used the Samsung Switch app and downloaded all of my photos, messages, apps, passwords, etc.  They make it so easy.  The photos/camera on this phone are PHENOMINAL.  If you are thinking about switching, this is a great inro phone to Android.  Give yourself about a month to get used to the new OS though.  Don't give up.  I promise you won't regret it.

"I was a little apprehensive spending more on a used phone than I spent on my new OnePlus 6T 4 years ago. I'd done the research and decided on the Galaxy S22 Ultra (mostly for the phone capabilities) but wasn't willing to spend $1200, so I took a chance on a refurb unit. I've had it for a couple days now and I can say it was one of my better purchases.The phone arrived a day early, well packaged, and included the phone(w/37% battery charge), an adaptive fast charger, a cheap usb c charging cable, and sim removal tool. After close inspection, the phone showed no signs of prior ownership. It was in pristine condition just like new. It started right up and I got through the setup process. Being an unlocked phone,I figured I could just throw in my Cricket sim card and be ready to go. Cricket recognized the phone straight away, reminded me to turn on wireless calling, and I was back in business. Now let's get it charged up.I plugged in my OP6T usb c cable and powerpack out of habit and started messing with settings when I ran across the battery settings. It showed 2 hour, 13 minutes until fully charged. Ok, lets try the included charger and cable. I setup the included charging rig and the charging time was reduced to 42 minutes. Sweet!... until it wasn't. With the phone fully charged, I went to unplug the charger only to find it stuck in the phones usb port. No amount of wiggling in any direction would free it. Time to turn to Google for a solution. Not much help there other than someone suggesting sending the phone in for charging port replacement after suggesting the fast charger combined with a cheap cable may have allowed an arc to form in the port effectively ""welding"" the cable to the port. Panic set in as I resumed the wiggling process. I finally decided to pull harder and dislodge it, whatever the outcome. It came out finally. I plugged in my ""good"" cable and it showed ""charged"" so I knew it was working. I quickly disposed of the cheap usb cable so it could cause to more harm. Crisis averted.I can tell that the signal reception is much better than I had with my old phone. My old phone had good early morning reception where I work but it was shut down at 9:30 A.M. for the rest of the day. I was happy to see that was no longer the case with this phone. I had useable signal even inside the building. That in itself is huge to me.This a is a large phone. I work construction and wear carpenter jeans (with the pocket on the right leg) and all my previous phones slid right in that pocket with a slim case. This phone will barely fit naked. With the case I bought for it, it won't even begin to fit. Luckily the Unicorn Beetle Pro case has the belt clip so I can still carry it while at work... although I'm not a fan of the belt clip method. The case is very protective but makes the phone even huge(er). I have a slim case on order.The phone itself is fast, responsive and beautiful with more bells and whistles than any phone I've owned to date. It's going to take some time to start learning the tips and tricks that make this phone stand out from the crowd, otherwise it's a waste of this phones ""talent"". I'm hoping my luck and the longevity of the phone will keep this as my daily driver for years to come as Samsung has promised four generations of One UI and Android OS upgrades.(tl:dr) It's a big glorious phone sent safely at a good price. IMO... if you can swing the price, don't hesitate.

"Product:  Amazon Renewed 'Excellent Condition' Galaxy S22 UltraMerchant: RE-CELLSummary: Bottom line is I ordered a Factory Unlocked S22 Ultra from Re-Cell in 'Excellent' condition, and this is exactly what I received.  A lot of sellers will claim their phone is 'unlocked' but this is often not the case.  RE-CELL provided the exact phone as listed - SM-S908U1 (correct SKU for USA unlocked Samsung S22u).My new phone came in much better packaging (Small 'Box' designed for smart phones) which is MUCH better than most merchants would provide.  Also included was a fast charger and the correct USBc cable.  The phone was in a protective plastic sleeve and literally looks brand new, not a single blemish front/back/sides.  I'm not sure if this phone was refurb'd for a cracked screen or not, its literally impossible to tell.  If so, the replacement looks and feels as good as Samsung OEM.  It looks, feels and performs like a brand new phone in every aspect.Considering this particular S22 Ultra was also one of the cheapest for an 'Excellent' condition S22u, Re-Cell is my new go-to merchant whenever I'll need to use the Amazon Renewed program in the future.

"The Samsung phone I ordered indicated it was refurbished/excellent condition, and it is in almost perfect condition.  The only thing I have noticed are some tiny scratches on one edge of the screen.  I’m very satisfied with the phone, but the charger cord that came with it is an iPhone cord. I received the phone about 5 weeks ago and have made numerous calls to GreenTech, but no one ever answers.  I have left several voicemails and sent an email to them, but have gotten no response, so I’m giving them 4 stars instead of 5.  I don’t know that I would ever purchase another phone from them.Additional comments:After posting this review, I decided to try contacting the company through Amazon.  I  probably should have tried this sooner.  They responded quickly and gave me a $15 refund so I could purchase a replacement cord myself.  Still not sure about the lack of response from their tech line.  Glad there was nothing wrong with my phone!

"I had ordered an s22 ultra 256G renewed from another vendor (Hybrid IT) and the phone came without an S pen and had a lot of scratches even tho I went for the excellent condition. Moreover that phone's back glass was not glued properly as if the battery was bulging out. It was also loading with an att&t logo even tho I ordered unlocked. At that point I was discouraged because I always buy renewed phones on Amazon and never had issues.I decided to return that phone and tried to order from a different vendor. These guys (MOBILE SUPPLY) went above and beyond and sent me a very clean s22 ultra 256G even tho I ordered 128G since it was cheaper. The phone is fully unlocked and works well.
"
"Phone was in excellent condition. Worked fine from what I saw, but it did not accept my SIM card because it was still locked to AT&T service. Tried to contact AT&T to unlock phone, but request was denied because the phone was still associated with a current AT&T account. Wondering if that means the phone was stolen? Really disappointed I wasted my time. This is the second seller this has happened with now. Hope I get my full refund. Phone was shown to have arrived back to seller 2 days ago.  Still have not received a full refund. I will update if I get my full refund.
"
"Had issues 3 days in a row.Put screen protector on phone before usingso it stayed new .Seller rapid refund.Would buy from again in futurecause return speedand standing behind product . If you have issues send them a message on product to resolve.
"
"After an initial misunderstanding through Amazon customer support, I was in touch with the seller who was very helpful and understanding. I had tried to use red pocket Mobile for the phone and it just didn't work. I switched to Verizon and it works great, and they said at the store it is unlocked.
"
"xcelente equipo  me encanto para mi le doy 5 estrellas gracias
"
"Great phone for a great price. The phone is in perfect condition and I couldn't as for anything else.
"
"I bought an ""excellent"" grade phone but it had some pretty noticeable cosmetic issues along the sides. Some scratches on the screen and a noticeable crease through the screen that is visible through a protector, likely from a bad screen repair. The s pen also seems to have a sharp edge on its worn down nib & will need to be replaced to prevent scratches to the screen.
"
"Ordered this phone because company guarantees their phones are unlocked, they are not unlocked, I bought accessories  and a new sim card and service from my carrier , paid overnight shipping  for the sim card added this phone to my carrier account only to have no service because  the phone can't be activated  on another carriers service, message said to contact  verizon  and verison said we can not unlock thus phone, return it immediately and  now I have to wait for a shady company  to receive  the returned phone to get a refund so I've ordered  a real unlocked phone for cheaper through samsung and now waiting for that phone to come meanwhile  due to  purchasing  from this company I'm out way more money then I paid for the phone and going without a phone for over a total of 2 weeks plus not getting  my refund for probably  2 weeks as well... don't purchase any electronics from this company, by factory reset they mean all they did was wipe the previous owners info from phone but phone is not unlocked by any means

"This phone (Samsung S22 Ultra) looks brand new. It is exactly what it claims to be, excellent.
"
"The item was in excellent condition. NO scratches or faults on the phone. It came unlocked and works well with my country's network.
"
"Very nice. As described. Using it works great
"
"This was my very first Luxury phone purchase. I was very happy when I got this phone. It was beautiful and it worked great. However after having the phone shy of 3 weeks the phone would no longer connect to my data. I did all of the trouble shooting and even went in store to my phone carrier and they basically told me that I had a badly refurbished phone. This company  that I purchased the phone from claimed that the phone was in ""excellent"" condition. That was a lie. So now I have no phone because they didnt have a replacement to send me. I have not been refunded my $700 yet and they made me pay to return the crappy phone on top of all of the other hassles. Now i'm waiting for my refund. I wouldnt be surprised if there is one last obstacle these scammers may try and put me through before they refund me. I will update once this is resolved...
"
"The phone I received was in great condition. There were barely any scratches.  Screen looks and functions well and battery holds a good charge. The software was updated to the latest Android 14 and Samsung's One UI 6.0. The good news is this phone will also receive the soon to be released, One UI 6.1.As you might know the Galaxy S Ultra series of phones are Samsung's flagship phones, so I'm not going to go into reviewing its features. There are plenty of others that have done this. Just know you are getting a top-of-the-line phone.The only issue I had and it was irritating was that the phone was still locked to the previous carrier, ATT. So this did not meet the item description of being unlocked (hence one start down). I was able to get ahold of the seller and they gave me an unlock code. The other thing is, I noticed there is a dust particle stuck in the bottom third lens. Not sure if this is going to affect any of my pictures but thus far have not noticed anything.
"
"The S22 ultra I received was absolutely immaculate not even the slightest blemish,everything on the inside software/hardware whatever was in perfect operating order it just would not connect to my provider so unfortunately I had to return it but I would certainly order a phone from this company again, Five stars for sure!
"
"I ordered a ""Good"" condition renewed s22 Ultra.  There were no scratches on the front or back of the device, with the only damage being a few dings in the bottom of the phone where it looked like it may have been dropped by the previous owner.  The phone works perfectly.On top of the accurate description of the product's condition, RE-CELL checked to make sure the phone was compatible with Xfinity before sending the device since I had previously purchased an unlocked s22 from a different seller that turned out not to have been fully unlocked.The phone came in a very professional package, with plenty of protective foam to keep the phone safe in transit, as well as a charger with wall adapter.  I'm very happy with my experience and feel comfortable recommending this seller to anyone else in the market for a renewed s22 Ultra!
"
"Bought a Samsung s22 ultra from this seller and less than a month my network has issues, dropping every 5minutes phone gets hot after 3mins of use....must say the condition is decent 8/10
"
"Bought a S22 ultra phone works perfect and looks brand new and the s pen works perfect it arrived on time and was packaged well this was my first phone purchase from Amazon and would definitely use this seller for any future purchases
"
"I simply love this phone. The quality and the model of the phone looks like new. No issues so far I have been using this product from last 2months and actually enjoying this cool new phone. It comes without a box but it does have the charging cable.It arrived very well packed and I can recommend this product and the seller.
"
"I've had this phone for a year now and I couldn't have been happier. Best phone I've ever had with an awesome camera, great battery life, fantastic look and feel, . . . . .
"
"En la descripción dice muy claramente que el teléfono está desbloqueado de fabrica y no es así, intentamos colocar el SIM de 3 proveedores diferentes y a todos nos pedía el código de desbloqueo el cual no se nos proporciono.
"
"Works perfect in Brazil, fully unlocked.

 Decía en condiciones excelentes y está en muy malas condiciones para su precio
"
"ceived the product within 24 hours of placing my order. After ordering I read a few reviews with concerns relating to the unlocked status of the phone and minor scratches/cosmetic damages that surpassed the ""like new"" condition description.To my relief, the phone arrived unlocked (for any carrier), and with absolutely zero cosmetic flaws to note. The screen was perfectly smooth, with a protective cover placed over it, and there edges of the phone were also covered in a plastic shield.All-in-all, the phone could have passed off as brand new apart from the non-OEM packaging.
"
"Phone arrived in like new condition. I turned it on and it worked, but I did not set it up. The top heading on the Amazon listing says it is the US Version, yet the Product Description in the middle of the page says it is the International Version. I asked for clarification in the Customer Q&A section and did not get a response. I decided to return the phone because I was not sure what I was getting with this Amazon Renewed phone and I was able to find a brand new phone with warranty elsewhere for $200 less if I changed my cell service for 4 months.
"
"I've had this cellphone for over a year now and am completely happy with its performance. It has an excellent camera, and I've almost stopped using my SLR in deference to the one in the phone. I've rated the face recognition average, because it doesn't seem to recognize me reliably, but that is not a big concern to me. Likewise, with a screen protector installed, it does not accept my fingerprint for unlocking, but I'm happy using a different method. It has great sound quality and holds all my contacts perfectly. It is easy to use and I've installed several apps on it that I find useful too. It would easily go two days without charging.
"
"I had a Galaxy S8+ that I purchased new back in 2017.  I have used that phone every day since: it was great -and did everything I needed my phone to do.  But alas, it started to slow down and sometimes shutdown and not automatically restart after updates.  So, it was time for a new phone.I am not a social media person, and while I take some photos and videos, they are minimal.  However, I do use my phone as a vital assistant/substitute for my computer: research, email, communication, especially while away from the office (I am frequently in Court for business).  To replace my old phone, I decided to purchase the S22 Ultra (instead of the S23 Ultra) only because the difference in price.  The ""new"" functionality of the S23 Ultra was not enough to get me to spend an extra $500 plus dollars.That said, the S22 Ultra (black) with 256 GB and 12 GB of RAM is an amazing phone.  The reviews are correct that the phone is powerful, the screen size is great and high-definition clarity is amazing.  I still don't want to watch movies on a such a tiny screen -- but if there was nothing else to do, it will work in a pinch.  The sound quality is superb, the speed of loading apps/attachments/files and the refresh rate are off the charts!  So far the battery life is exactly what is advertised -- even with the high definition of the screen and the size of the screen, the phone power is efficient.  And the S Pen is very handy!To sum up - I am very happy with my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra phone!  I hope I get another six years -- but even at only four years, it will have more than paid for itself as the work horse I need!
"
"I'd like to first note that the transaction was amazing, received in under 24 hrs after ordering, came in perfect condition.5 star phone▪︎Amazing cameras,100x zoom,8k24 compatible▪︎Amazing display , 1440p 120fps(can go all the way down from 1hx to a max of 120hz, I must say the display is so beautiful especially when watching UHD HDR videos!▪︎S pen, I personally haven't used it too much but it can be very useful for artists, writing signatures,  taking pictures along with many other tasks.▪︎fast chip!! It uses the snapdragon 8 gen 1 which appears to work perfectly for demanding tasks such as hard-core gaming , multi tasking or even multi windows running simultaneously,  I personally haven't experienced 0 lags or stutters.▪︎security is top tier !! It's secured by Samsung Knox, has a secured folder, fingerprint reader(in screen) and facial recognition (along with all the other standard security options) the fingerprint works perfectly no issues.There's much more to mention but that's what came to mind, over all if you're looking for a premium phone and want a high-quality device , this phone definitely gets the job done by far with no issues, I'd highly advise a phone case as this phone is not cheap.Love it!

"I ordered the used like new through Amazon warehouse. What I received was the device in original packaging, sealed, and the device had the original plastic protective films on the front, back, and sides of the device. The usbc cable was still had the plastic fasteners on it. I am pretty sure someone must have ordered the device and sent it back without ever using it or even opening the box. So essentially I got a New device for the price of a used one.The device itself is phenomenal. Exactly what you expect for the most premium of Samsung android smartphones with the best of the best under the hood. Absolutely fantastic purchase.

"Very good phone, very fast, and also very expensive.  Came in 2 days which was very nice, cause my other phone was broke.  Unlocked model works great with Verizon.  Camera is very good.  Fingerprint reader works but I have not installed the screen protector yet.  I mostly use the pin, iv never had good luck with fingerprints cause mine get beat up.  Battery charges really fast, I like that alot.  Battery seems to last pretty good depending on how hard your working it. Last me all day and then some, and only takes like an hour to charge.  Gave it 4 stars only cause it's soo expensive.  But I'm happy I got it.
"
"what can I say, its a great phone. Great camera, great screen. Good battery (could be better) However it is 7 to 8 hours screen on time. Make sure you restart phone every few weeks to keep battery going strong.  Also download the ""Good Lock"" app. It will help customize your phone more.

 I ordered this phone and sent it to a friend overseas to bring it home for me so I don't have the box to do an unboxing. It can't without the pin to open the sim tray but had the original USB in the original box. My friend thought it had scratches around the rim since I bought it used- very good, but the plastic hadn't even been taken off yet to my delight. The battery was low when she got it and dead when I got it and took about 10 minutes to boot up while being charged on a powerbank. The camera quality is unmatched and I'm coming from an s20 ultra. Phone is unlocked as quoted as you can see in the video and comes with advertised storage. Spen works flawlessly and speakers are good, the same as my s20 ultra. I haven't written a review on this website for so long, but I had to write one for this sweet purchase!

"El teléfono es muy bueno, me tomó un poco de tiempo decidirme por adquirirlo pero va de maravilla. El único aspecto es que consume bastante batería, por cuestiones de trabajo, lo uso de 9 a 10 horas diarias y hasta ahora la manera en extender su batería por estos periodos es con ayuda de la opción de power saving. Sus cámaras con muy buenas y considero que el equipo es muy fácil de utilizar, en lo personal no utilizo el S-pen pero es agradable contar con él sobre todo por algunas de sus funciones.
"
"El Celular es internacional, lo compré en Usa vendido por Amazon, llego antes de lo esperado y en excelente condiciones, hasta el momento todo anda funcionando superbién y lo mejor es que trae Snapdragon, ya como pase el tiempo actualizaré la reseña
"
"Llego sellado y nuevo. Todo en orden y hasta el día de hoy es un avión. No hubo temas en la compra ni con la entrega ya con código, eso si lo abrí frente al repartidor y como que no le gusto pero entiende que han tenido malos manejos algunos. Igual pude facturar sin temas la compra.
"
"xcelente celular, gran desempeño y muy buena batería. hasta el momento ha funcionado muy bien.adicional llego super rápido y seguro. estoy feliz con mi compra
"
"Es muy buen teléfono para sacar fotos, videos y sobre todo ver películas y poder dibujar con el spen, pero para lo que realmente lo compre que es para jugar juegos como Mobile Legends y Lol su rendimiento no me gustó

"I recently upgraded my phone to the Galaxy S22 Ultra, primarily for its enhanced camera capabilities to capture stunning pictures of customers' homes. The phone arrived promptly and was in impeccable condition considering it was refurbished. However, the only downside was that the stylus was missing from the package. Nevertheless, the seller's exceptional customer service made up for it.Upon discovering the missing stylus, I immediately contacted the seller for assistance. I was pleasantly surprised by the outstanding level of customer service I received from Olivia. She went above and beyond to ensure that I would be fully reimbursed for the cost of the replacement stylus. Her dedication and promptness in resolving the issue left me highly impressed.As for the phone itself, I am extremely satisfied with its quality. The Galaxy S22 Ultra boasts impressive improvements compared to its predecessor. The device is noticeably faster, providing a smooth and seamless user experience. The screen quality is exceptional, with vibrant colors and excellent clarity, truly enhancing the visual experience.The highlight of the Galaxy S22 Ultra is undoubtedly its camera. With superior camera quality, I can now confidently capture breathtaking shots of customers' homes. The enhanced capabilities allow me to truly showcase the beauty and intricacies of their living spaces. The camera's performance under various lighting conditions, coupled with its advanced features, ensures that every shot is crisp, detailed, and visually stunning.In addition to the camera, the phone offers a plethora of additional features that enhance productivity and convenience. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making navigation a breeze. The battery life is impressive, providing extended usage without constantly worrying about running out of power.Overall, the Galaxy S22 Ultra is an exceptional device that has exceeded my expectations. Its speedy performance, improved screen quality, and outstanding camera capabilities make it a perfect tool for capturing professional-quality pictures in customers' homes. Despite the minor setback of the missing stylus, the exceptional customer service provided by Olivia resolved the issue satisfactorily. I highly recommend the Galaxy S22 Ultra to all photography enthusiasts and professionals seeking a top-of-the-line smartphone experience.

"The samsung galaxy S22 ultra is one of the best phones I've ever owned! The only reason I have 4 stars is because I paid for excellent condition but received a phone that had dents and scratches all around the perimeter of the device. Other than that the phones in good condition. I received all the updates which was nice to have a phone running android 13. Great seller, I say this because the phone was an AT&T just like I wanted. This is my 3rd galaxy through Amazon. The 1st two devices said they were factory unlocked only for us to find out they were t mobile unlocked which meant the phones were stuck on Android 12 because they couldn't update over AT&T it happened with 2 of my devices as well as 2 of my wife's devices so finally this seller was lucky that they told the truth and gave us the correct phones.The s22 ultra is one of the best phones I've ever owned. It's powerful, fast and has decent battery life. It's just as good as the S23 ultra for half the price,  highly recommend buying this device!
"
"The refurbished phone looked good, but found it would not pick up WiFi. Sent it back to greentech the label they gave me sent phone to a warehouse not repair place. They had phone a month then sent it back because screen got broken and they did not fix WiFi original problem. DO NOT BUY FROM greentech !!
"
"Even with that small defect, the short time that I had it I can say that it is a great phone with an amazing camera, in perfect conditions.
"
"I needed a upgrade and purchased this one I'm glad I did I really like this phone so far...am leaving this review with it. No issues and everything works as described am very pleased.
"
"The only flaw I coukd find was a tiny scratch on the screen about 2 millimeters long.  Otherwise the phone looks flawless.  The font was not 100% reset so I reset it and put it back to factory spec.For about 1/3 of what I paid a your ago for basically the same phone I'm very pleased.  Got this as a birthday present for my 22 year old son.  He loves it
"
"The outside of the phone perfect condition and the phone is working fine but the pen isn't working at all reached out to the seller to see if they could replace the pen no response from them.
"
"Looks brand new im very happy
"
"Definitely buying just from them for future purchases s22 ultra came mint condition thanks guys
"
"Phone work great at the moment hope will be no problem next few weeks. But work great look beautiful to
"
"I was worried since there was bad reviews about theirs not coming unlocked but mine did. Easy transfer of sim card and there was no scratches or cracks. Good price for used I think it's nice <3
"
"Great device only problem is when I'm gaming it gets s little too hot but games don't crash, great device
"
"Excelente estado muy recomendado
"
"will not charge phone , it may start to charge but never completely charges ,Will not fast or super fast charge at all.! I paid $811.89 and expect a full return!
"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I had to go to the boost mobile shop to activate the device, becouse didn't recognize the sim card, but ain't take more than 5 minutes. Everything seems perfect.
"
"Edit: Originally I had left a bad review due to the aftermarket screen used.I'm simply returning to state that, after allowing the screen to adjust to the oils on my hand for a couple of days, it functions incredibly well.My advice would be, if anyone is experiencing problems with their S-Pen or fingers sticking to the surface, either order a screen-protector and apply it on day 1, or simply wait for some time to acclimate.I'm coming off the back of another malfunctioning unit, and this one performs beyond my expectations, I simply needed some patience.
"
"If you are in the market for an S22 Ultra and looking at a cheaper price, this will be best phone.  I got this prior to my S23 Ultra and works fine. Battery life was good,  minimal to zero scratches.  My daughter who is in middle school uses this phone. Value for money.
"
"S22 ultra nice condition very satisfied!!
"
"i loved the s21 ultra and this is just the same phone on steroids. i still haven't figured everything out but its fun learning.
"
"So LOCKED to T-Mobile, That Even T-Mobile Couldn't Unlock It. Beware!!I took this to a T-Mobile Store and they couldn't unlock it. I then talked to the National  Support (Corporate) Team, who are the only ones who can unlock it if a Retail store cannot. Guess what? They couldn't unlock it either. Something about the previous phone owner not fulfilling their obligations and meeting the requirements to allow a phone to be unlocked. I caution you when buying from these guys.
"
"I ordered a used Samsung S22 Ultra from this company and the phone came in excellent condition. It looked to be brand new. The price was great and the phone works perfect. I'm very satisfied with the purchase.
"
"Love the phone and how seamless it pairs with all of my smart devices.  The quality of the phone is outstanding and the battery life is way better hsm my Pixel 6 Pro.  I wonder why did I wait so long.
"
"The phone is in good condition work ok but am a bit disappointed because the phone is lock to T mobile and cannot work in my country. In the description it didn't say that the phone was lock so am a bit disappointed good phone overall tho.
"
"I FEEL SO CONFORTABLE WITH THIS SAMSUNG PHONE S22 ULTRA WAS SO EASY THE TRANSICION FROM MY OLD PHONE TO THIS NEW PHONE
"
"The phone came in it's original box and without any defects. It also had the pesky little plastic covering on the side frame that Samsung installs and the phone was completely indistinguishable from a brand new phone. Good job!
"
"It is still locked under Verizon. Not worth the money or the run around bs. DO NOT BUY THE PHONE
"
"Could not use the phone feature, received a Verizon locked phone.
"
"Great purchase for refurbished S22 ultra. It was very easy to switch service to this unlocked phone. When I got phone only little problem was the pen wasn't connecting to phone so I contacted the seller the same day I received it an they replied back same day. They replaced the pen an I received it within a few days. So I must say customer service was great. Very happy customer an worth the buy in my opinion.
"
"After waiting longer than what the delivery dates was, I got my phone. I put in the SIM card and the phone isn't working. I followed all the instructions and still my phone will not make calls, texts, or internet. I call my phone provider and they tell me the phone is locked. I run a small business and I need my phone to help run that. Don't wast your time or money. I called a number that the seller provided for customer support and no one picks up. If I could give them a zero I would.
"
"I was nervous buying a phone from Amazon but everything was good. Package arrived a day early with the phone, Sims pin and charging cable. When I turned the phone on it said ATT which had me confused at first. When I inserted my Verizon Sim card it gave me the option to configure the phone for Verizon. After I factory reset the phone and set up the phone as brand new. It downloaded all of my Verizon apps as well. One thing i can say is the s22 Ultra's battery drains pretty quick so id suggest a portable charger or a charging case for back up during the day. But the phonne charges quickly. The phone is unlocked! Such a great price for what it is. I didn't have scratches or dings on the phone either. Worth the buy for such a cool phone. Mind you, I'm switching from a iPhone to android. Best decision ever!! 👏
"
"This phone was a fantastic buy! I didn't want to get into a long expensive contract with my carrier and am not interested in overpriced phones as soon as they are released. So, when I was shopping for a replacement for my Galaxy 20+ (which I bought renewed directly from Samsung), I turned to Amazon's refurbished listings.  It took a while to find what phone I wanted and then what seller I trusted. I knew I wanted an ""excellent"" phone, and the few dollars difference didn't matter and neither did the color.  I finally found this phone from a reputable seller and took the dive and ordered it.  It shipped in a very secure box, in its original phone box, with the protective tape on the front as well!  This phone was like new.  It doesn't look like anybody ever used it.  I used my Samsung switch program, switched sim cards, and voila!  (Well, not really, Verizon gave me a couple issues but I got it working!)  I love this phone and for the money you can't beat it.  And this seller is great! If I need anything else I will check to see if they have it first.Side note:  The S pen:  I keep forgetting I have it and it was not the prime reason I bought this phone.  I'm sure I'll start using it more as time goes on.  I do keep getting errors that it won't connect and may need to replace it. It is impossible to tell if it is the original pen or a knockoff.
"
"Llegó antes de lo esperado , en excelentes condiciones , 100% desbloqueado y el S Pen le funciona muy bien. Súper contenta y satisfecha con mi compra.
"
"Be Aware! My phone was flagged as stolen by AT&T !!!!After one month of using the phone, uploading all my data, and working with my settings until everything was perfect, the phone stopped making/receiving calls or texts. I called AT&T and they informed me that the previous owner reported the phone as stolen. AT&T told me there was nothing they could do. I contacted the vendor and they said they didn't know what was happening and advised me to return the phone. I was very disappointed because I spent hours setting up the phone.1. Amazon should verify the vendors if they are backing them up2. AT&T should check the phone as soon as you install the system. Not after a month3. The vendor should be very careful and check that the phone they sell you wasn't stolenI read at least another case with this vendor where they sold a stolen phone.I returned the phone and got a refund.
"
"After searching various web sites for my galaxy s22 ultra I selected re-cell. I was satisfied with the price and the phone arrived much earlier then promised.  The phone looked and function like a new phone. You can not tell it is a renewed phone.
"
"Phone came to me in excellent condition minus the packaging was very banged up. Not a scratch on the phone, looked brand new. However, I am disappointed in the battery life. It seems to drain fast with just streaming videos and light gaming. I suspect they didn't renew the battery and it came half life from previous owner, but I guess that's a chance you take for renewed phones. I just would have expected better/ longer battery life from a 5000 mah battery, and paying over $700 buckos
"
"Aun y cuando es un renewed. El producto esta al 100% buen balance en calidad y costo.
"
"El teléfono tiene un error,Se desconecta muy seguido de la red Telcel, por lo tanto se cortan las llamadas,  te dice sin conexión de red. Tienes que estar reiniciando constantemente el teléfono para que vuela a tener a tener conexión.
"
"Super cuidado y funcional al 100
"
"Having the Galaxy S22 for a couple years now I love the phone. The cameras, with optical zoom lenses and great AI to optimize scenes, pro video and raw photo modes. Battery life, signal reception, processing speed... if you're looking at this review you know this phone is top of the line and it does deliver the goods. Unfortunately I lost my original one.I am writing this review because I was hesitant to buy a ""renewed"" phone, and unsure what I would get. Well, I'm here to tell you I have been pleasantly surprised. The phone arrived early from what was quoted by Amazon. Emails came automatically from FedEx and were fairly accurate. I ordered the phone on a Friday before a Monday federal holiday, and Amazon quoted it to arrive Tuesday. Within the next 24 hours I received an email from FedEx saying to expect a delivery on Monday, between ~8am and noon. There were a couple follow up emails and the phone did eventually arrive a little after 1pm.Already I was pleasantly and unexpectedly satisfied with the service as the phone had arrived a day earlier than expected. The only downside was that Verizon was unable to activate the phone over another phone, because there was no sim card installed. Even before receiving the phone I was afraid that I would not get an unlocked version or something else would impede my ability to get this one working to replace the one I had just lost. After an hour or so trying with Verizon tech support they finally indicated I needed to go to a Verizon store and get a free sim card. I was able to get to the store nearby before they closed. The process was easy and fast, and I had the phone connected and my phone number back in no time. It took a couple of tries to get accounts set up and synced, but my ""new"" phone is essentially the same as the old.The phone sent to me by Re-Cell was in great shape. If there were not a few very minor dings on the top and bottom of the body of the phone I would think it was brand new and unused. Someone must have replaced the screen, or the person who owned it before installed a screen protector and good case, because the screen and back of the phone show no signs of wear and tear, let alone damage.So far no operations have been less than my previous new S22 Ultra. In fact, I may even be getting better battery life from this one, which could have as much to do with having a phone cleaned of old files, etc, but I get the impression that either the battery was replaced, or this phone was not used heavily before it was refurbished.This phone ""feels"" newer than the one I lost, which did have a couple scratches on the screen. Other than having to spend money on a new phone, (my Wells Fargo credit card phone protection does not cover lost phones, only theft) the only major downside to losing my old phone was the time I spent looking for it, and going through the process to get this one and set it up... a story I will not tell here.From my experience with Amazon Renewed and Re-Cell, I do not plan to buy another new phone when the time comes that I ever need another. I will find the phone I want here and buy it used in excellent condition like the one that was shipped to me. Very satisfied with this experience.
"
"Love the looks. It's simple yet very cute. Great quality. I have already dropped my phone and it protected it very well.
"
"seller sent Defective product.
"
"Internet is slow and not available in certain areas. 😒 alerts don't vibrate
"
"The phone is exactly as described unlocked and looks new in every way. Shipping was very fast. Very pleased.
"
"I previously bought from a different seller and had to return it.I found this one and messaged the seller about my previous issue. They were very helpful with making sure that I got the right one. It works great and no issues at all.It came 2 days early and is in excellent shape with no scratches anywhere. Thank you so much for your help. Definitely recommend!
"
"Just got it a few hours ago and through setting it up and everything it has worked perfectly. Came unlocked and fast! only minor issue was it was definitely a bit scratched up and dirty (not the screen just the metal but i dont mind those scratches since its not a brand new phone). You do have to sign for the package which i didnt realize and was luckily home for it when it got delivered.
"
"The renewed s 22 ultra looks great as was bought in excellent condition but as for the battery life I'm disappointed as my other 3 year old samsung galaxy A 71 5g seems to have better life.
"
"I upgraded to a S22 Ultra from a S20 FE, and I thought that phone was the best I'd had. The fingerprint reader is almost in the middle of the screen which does take some getting used to. However, the fingerprint reader is the most sensitive of any phone I've had. Battery life isn't any better or worse than what I've had, in spite of its 5000mah battery. But the S Pen...for me using this phone for personal, business and photography....it's a gamechanger and the main reason purchased this phone.The phone arrived in New condition, and 3 days faster than what I'd expected. For the price, quality and longevity, I definitely recommend this phone.
"
"This was a gift for my mother's birthday.Came with a Verizon SIM lock. After meeting the unlock requirements, I worked for over a month with dozens of agents from Samsung and Verizon - nobody can figure out the problem.
"
"Flawless. 10 out of 10. No damage, no scratch, no problems at all. It's like it came straight from Samsung.
"
"I honestly believe this was a new phone. Immaculate condition couldn't find a single scratch on it, still had plastic wrap on the sides
"
"i dropped it once and the corner of the side plates cracked. only had it a few days. out of the 3 years i have my iphone 12 i dropped in 100s of times and no scratches or cracks anywhere on it. the rest is good, camera is amazing
"
"The phone will not connect to the Verizon network even though the only reason I bought it was because it said it would work on the Verizon network. The AT&T logo pops up when it boots up and I have tried Sim cards from different networks but nothing works. Extremely unhappy that I wasted 2 to 3 hours on this and now have to pay for return shipping. I tried contacting the customer service department and they sent an email saying they would look into the troubleshooting but then that was it. I don’t have forever to get the phone working when it should’ve been working as soon as I received it. Beware and don’t buy from “green tech refurbished”.

"I bought this for my husband and when he went to Verizon to set it up they told him the phone was stolen and it locked him out of his own account.He then spent 2 hours in store trying to get back into his account using his old phone.Waiting to hear a reply from the seller.
"
"My son loves his ultra 22 with pen. Thank you

"
"No need to say more. I received and realized after 3 days of use that there's a deep 0.5 inch scratch on the screen at middle left area
"
"I don't like that this seller group came up as unlocked phones when they're not unlocked phones! I hate going through these extra steps to unlock a phone that was supposed to already be unlocked! Arses! I'm about to send it back!
"
"After being trapped under a company owned iPhone for the past 11 years, it's wonderful to again have a phone that fits, and functions precisely as I need,without issue.  Cameras are outstanding; better that my HD TV.  It's easy to setup exactly the way I want it; not like that last grief box.  What's better, I don't have to get permission to load the content I want; no blessing from the iTunes pope needed.  Service is great everywhere I go, indoors or out.  I'm free!
"
"I bought 2 of these specifically because they were advertised as T-Mobile phones, one was and one was not. Pretty disappointed as my phone now does not have regular T-Mobile capabilities. Overall there was no damage to either phone, batteries don't last long but that's pretty much to be expected with refurbished electronics.
"
"I have never bought a refurbished phone let alone one this expensive and new. I'm taking a vacation soon and I mainly bought it for the camera. The camera is AWESOME! I am still learning about everything which is hard for an old lady without  any paperwork at all included. But the phone is beautiful and fast and I looked with a magnifying glass and there wasn't a single scratch on it. So far so good.
"
"Super great value for the refurbished phone. It came looking like brand new with brand new accessories. Saved hundreds over going new and the phone works great.
"
"I really enjoyed  this phone it was basically  brand new . Besides  a small dent on the corner.
"
"This item is defective when i received it and its already been 3 months and no refund yet.
"
"This is a mint condition cell phone that seems to work like a new one. The price was decent, delivered very fast and secure. I would recommend this company, I  will he no problem buying from them again.
"
"Hot battery on certain tasks, mostly while gaming, slow loading
"
"Product is perfect!  I was expecting a device with some signs of use since this is a renewed until. To my surprise I can't find a single scuff or scratch!  My only complaint was the shipping time. I was told I would have the unit on the 3rd but it was actually the 9th before I received it. Even knowing that I would still order again.
"

"I really liked it for having 2 slots for SIM cards

"Quality and cost

"Afyer about 6 months of having this phone the LED light on the top right of the xamera does not cone off. It happened after an update and there seems to be no fix. Warranty is also out so I'd have to pay for any suggested remedies
"
"El equipo demoro 8 dias mas para la entrega luego de la fecha estipulada, en la descripcion marca que es doble sim y no lo es.
"
"UPDATE I write the seller and was refunded $80 for the incorrect color.So far this Phone work great. But I am not happy as I received a black phone. No one even called to find out if black was okay with me.  If I wanted a black phone I could have purchased another one at a different price.
"
"I like it so far
"
"I don't know what can be said that hasn't already on this phone, but I love it so much. I'm constantly finding more I love about it everyday. I love taking photos and I have taken some of the most amazing photos in my life with the camera(s) on this phone. I have full detailed pictures of the moon and the stars at night that I use to dream of taking as a teenager. The display is is a perfect size for me with crystal clear quality, and I keep it with the display usually dimmed with no problem seeing it day or night. I love the S Pen and I use it constantly now for everything in particular taking pictures hands free with the easy shutter button. The battery life is good to me but I keep the battery saver option turned on, which I like that Samsung considered this as an option. Also even though this was a renewed purchase this phone looked and worked like brand new. So to the seller thank you for saving me a lot and providing this perfect quality product that has changed my life. Excellent product and excellent service with this purchase, it even shipped fast with more than adequate shipping materials for its safe transport. I'm actually typing this review currently on it and that was another thing I wanted to add, this has predictive typing and error correction that also makes it a joy to type on. I don't have to fight with it like some phones, they like to auto correct the spelling or grammatical mistakes. This just gives me suggestions and most of the time it's actually right. Great phone and this was a fantastic price for it! I would definitely suggest purchasing this phone from this dealer if you are looking for it at a price that doesn't make you go broke paying off a phone. Lots of great features that I just couldn't cover all of in this review. When I do upgrade to another phone it's going to have to do a lot to surpass this phone. Thank you to the seller and Samsung for providing such a great buying experience.

"Estoy feliz, exactamente descrito.
"
"I bought a liberated phone but it only works on a T-Mobile network is not eligible to be unblocked.To where can I return it and get a refund.  It arrived on a small package without address.

"Bought the used acceptable phone. Came with a few scratches and no headphones. But works well. Battery life is good. I have nothing else to compare it to, but it's been working well so far. It's been several months.

"I upgraded from a Note 9.This phone came out of the box ready to go. The setup instructions were in English, i inserted the simcard and the phone did the rest. I then tethered it to my old phone, it comes with the tethering wire which can also be used as a charging cable. 20 minutes later i was ready to go with 5G. The simcard slot is a huge improvement over my previous phone.The processor is fast and i no longer need to carry a charger with me as the battery life is very long and the charging speed is so fast it only takes a few minutes to top it up before i leave the house. I highly recommend this phone but my perspective is from an upgrade of an older model, it might not be much of an upgrade from, say an S20, i have no idea but ib ill say this phone was wrth every penny for me.Update: ran into a few glitches, my friend suggested to check for a software update and once downloaded that did the trick. Note that it was not automatic i had to check for it maunually, this may solve any regional problems you have, it was quite a large download and made everything speed up and synch together.

"I purchased for $1600+ Turns out it's a unlocked, HK, Taiwan and China version that won't connect to Att-LTE or 5G. When it's registered to network it only works 2g, making phone useless. It will work on Tmobile 5G network. Since I used it for almost a week, I offered the seller to give me a partial refund, he declined and blamed me for not researching before I made my purchase. I said, I emailed you twice before I purchased, how much more should I research? So I was advised to return it and file a AtoZ claim if im not satisfied by Amazon rep. The Seller only  gave me back half of my money and $1 dollar for shipping.They also sent pictures to justify their actions.(They are posted) one picture was to show me it connects to Att, they didn't realize that the picture confirms my issue, it clearly shows it won't connect to LTE OR 5G network. Then another picture with severe damage on the corner, I had already told Amazon it had a scratch, but nothing like they show in the picture. I look at the damage and realize it's not even the phone I had purchased. They didn't realize that an Ultra s22 screen goes all the way to the edge. ALL NEW PREMIUM PHONES HAVE THAT! the picture they sent shows a phone with a black edge around it. (Picture is posted).Another picture shows the IMEI NUMBERS THAT CONFIRM IT'S NOT AN INTERNATIONAL UNLOCKED VERSION.IT'S AN ASIAN UNLOCKED VERSION FOR SALE IN HK TAIWAN AND CHINA.It only works with t-mobile..HORRIBLE EXPRIENCE.I DON'T RECOMMEND THESE MODELS IF YOU LIVE IN THE USA, AND DEFINITELY STAY AWAY FROM NGP STORE USA. DISHONEST SELLER!I GOT MY FULL REFUND THANK YOU AMAZON!

"Es u a verdadera lastima que el Samsung 22 Ultra no sea compatible con Cricket Wireless.  Me da mucha tristeza devolver los dos teléfonos que compré.😭😭

"It's great; but, get a good case. You'll need it. It's size factors into the force equation: F = M x A.

"The battery life is not that good. I paid $1500 for this phone and it goes down to 50% every day.

"I ordered this phone as my old phone got damaged unexpectedly. Shipping was a bit sketchy as the label was printed but the item wasn't shipped till about 5days after, but the package did still arrived on time. My real disappointment came when I received the phone and realised that it was shipped in a padded envelope, and the phone has been opened and resealed by the seller, I purchased expecting a brand new factory sealed device. When contacted, the seller indicated that they knew it was opened and couldn't do anything about the situation, but they did ensure me that it was a brand new device.Having used the device for about two weeks, it seems it is brand new, but a disclaimer that a resealed item may be sent before I purchased the item would have been appreciated. At that point I would have had the option to go ahead with the purchase or not.In terms of the phone itself, the battery is very unimpressive. I'm coming from a Huawei p20 pro that I had from release, and the s22 battery is comparable to the degraded 4000 mah battery I left on the Huawei. I'm not sure if it's an optimisation issue with Samsung, but I expected a lot more out of the battery. Other than this, its a great phone.

"他の出品よりも安く、レビューも微妙だったので不安だったが、ちゃんとまともなものが送られてきた上下の側面部分に擦り傷があるのが少し気になる
"
"The packaging and quick delivery was a pleasant surprise,  the phone arrived as if it were brand new.  Transferred my stuff over and that was it!. I also noticed the long battery life and quick charge.
"
"This phone is NOT DUAL SIM as advertised. Be aware.
