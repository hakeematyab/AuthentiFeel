# [AuthentiFeel â€“ Review Sentiment Analysis and Authenticity Detection System](https://github.com/hakeematyab/AuthentiFeel/blob/main/documents/authentifeel_project_report.pdf)
### Atyab Hakeem, Atreyo Das

**AuthentiFeel** is a sentiment analysis and authenticity detection system that leverages traditional machine learning algorithms to provide insightful and reliable analysis of product reviews. In an era where AI-generated content is increasingly common, discerning the authenticity of user feedback is as crucial as understanding its sentiment. This system is designed to meet these needs efficiently without the complexity and computational overhead associated with deep neural networks.
#### For more details [READ THIS.](https://github.com/hakeematyab/AuthentiFeel/blob/main/documents/authentifeel_project_report.pdf)

## Why AuthentiFeel?

- **Traditional Algorithms**: Utilizes well-established machine learning techniques, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVC), and Logistic Regression, combined through an ensemble method to improve accuracy and robustness.
- **Efficiency**: By avoiding complex models, AuthentiFeel reduces the necessary training and inference time significantly, making it not only faster but also less resource-intensive.
- **Lower Risk of Overfitting**: The simplicity of the model reduces the likelihood of overfitting, making AuthentiFeel reliable for real-world applications where the quality and genuineness of reviews are paramount.
- **Interpretable Models**: Unlike many modern deep learning approaches, the models used in AuthentiFeel are highly interpretable, meaning you can easily understand and trace how input features affect predictions. This transparency is crucial for trust and reliability in review analysis.
- **Dual Analysis**: AuthentiFeel performs both sentiment analysis and authenticity detection, providing a dual-layer of analysis to help businesses and consumers make informed decisions.

## Ideal for:
- **Consumers**: Gain clear and honest insights into product reviews, helping with informed purchasing decisions.
- **Businesses**: Understand true consumer sentiments and detect fake reviews efficiently, enhancing market performance analysis without heavy computational investments.

**AuthentiFeel** aims to bring reliability and clarity to review analysis, empowering users with genuine insights and a more transparent market view. Simple yet effective, it's an essential tool in the toolkit of any consumer or business seeking truth in data.

## Metrics

For sentiment analysis, accuracy was the metric of concern and for authenticity detection, precision was the metric of concern. Below are the results:

- **Sentiment Analysis Accuracy:** 87%
- **Authenticity Detection Precision** 95.6%
